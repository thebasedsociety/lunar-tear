# Lunar Tear

Private server research project for a certain discontinued mobile game.
Discord server: https://discord.gg/G3anrfcV

## How To Launch The Server

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Populated `server/assets/` directory

### Regenerate protobuf stubs

```bash
cd server
make proto
```

### Run

```bash
cd server
sudo go run ./cmd/lunar-tear \
  --host 10.0.2.2 \
  --http-port 8080 \
  --scene 13
```

`sudo` is needed because gRPC binds to port 443 (privileged). On Linux you can use `setcap` instead:

```bash
go build -o lunar-tear ./cmd/lunar-tear
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./lunar-tear
./lunar-tear --host 10.0.2.2 --http-port 8080 --scene 13
```

### Ports

| Protocol | Port | Notes                                                |
| -------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| gRPC     | 443  | hardcoded by the client, not configurable            |
| HTTP     | 8080 | Octo asset API + game web pages (`--http-port` flag) |

### Flags

| Flag                   | Default             | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--host`               | `127.0.0.1`         | hostname/IP given to the client                          |
| `--http-port`          | `8080`              | HTTP/Octo server port                                    |
| `--scene`              | `0`                 | bootstrap new users to scene N (0 = fresh start)         |
