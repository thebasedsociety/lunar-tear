## 2026-04-04

- Explore system
- In-app purchase flow

### Fixed

- Map freeze caused by gimmick schedule overflow — capped patched entries under the client's MaxGimmickSequenceSchedule=1024 limit

### Roadblock

- Retire quest/battle mechanism — still untraced for quest/battle
- Chapter transition loop — re-login after chapter 7 replays scene 261 instead of advancing

### Need to Figure Out

- Banner/gacha logic (scheduling, rates, pity, relationship between MomBanner and gacha catalogs)

## 2026-03-28

### Working

- Everything from 2026-03-21, plus:
- Costume enhancement (gold cost, material consumption, same-weapon-type EXP bonus)
- Shop (buying items, price deduction, starter item grants on new accounts)
- Mission progress tracking
- 3D viewer
- Event quests (start/finish/restart/update lifecycle, state tracking)
- Tutorial rewards with companion choices
- Battle drop rewards on quest finish
- Snapshot system for saving/loading user state per quest scene

### Roadblock

- Retire quest/battle mechanism — the abandon/withdraw flow for quests and battles hasn't been traced or implemented yet

### Need to Figure Out

- Rarity/awakening, and full client expectations (enhancement is done, rest TBD)
- Banner/gacha logic (scheduling, rates, pity, relationship between MomBanner and gacha catalogs)

## 2026-03-21

### Working

- Login and account creation flow (ToS, name entry, graphic settings, title completion)
- Deck configuration
- Cage ornament rewards
- Main quest progression up to the first battle-only quest obstacle

### Roadblock

- Battle-only quests — the quest engine handles story-driven quests but pure battle encounters use a different entry/exit path that hasn't been traced yet

### Need to Figure Out

- How costumes work in-game (equip rules, stats, rarity/awakening, client expectations)
- Banner/gacha logic (scheduling, rates, pity, relationship between MomBanner and gacha catalogs)
